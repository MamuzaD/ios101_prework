## App Brainstorming 

Favorite Apps:
- LetterBoxd
    - Rate my favorite movies
    - View friend's movie reviews
- TikTok
    - Short content
    - Share memes or videos with friends
- Discord
    - Talk with friends through messages
    - Voice channels and screen sharing
- Reddit
    - Just enjoy reading through posts
- Spotify
    - Listening to music
    - Sharing music through "Spotify Jam"

### Dream App Build

I would like to make a similar app to LetterBoxd where I could rate video games or music instead. Overall I really enjoy
LetterBoxd and their social platform, I think something similar for either video games or even music albums could be a really 
nice personal project, albeit a quite large one. I know it would require databases, user authentication, and crossplatform
development such as web and mobile apps. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was a bit confused with the simulator at first because it went to the Desktop instead of on top of XCode. 
Other than that the prework instructions are very helpful, especially with the example videos.
